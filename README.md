# Mission-to-Mars

## Purpose

The purpose of this project was to scrape data from the Nasa website and create a new webpage that automatically "scrapes" the Nasa website for the most recent news.

Utilizing Splinter, BeautifulSoup and Python, I populated a customized webpage with the most recent "Mars News", a "Featured Image" of the surface and four pictures of each Hemisphere of Mars. I then stored that scraped data on a MongoDB (NoSQL) database and then wrote a python script to display of data on a custom webpage utilizing flask.

To make my webpage more appealing to the user, I changed the default background to a light grey and changed the color of each sub-header to dark orange. I also created clickable thumbnails of the four hemispheres that will display a full resolution image in a new window.
